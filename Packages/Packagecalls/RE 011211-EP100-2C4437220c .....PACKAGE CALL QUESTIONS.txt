Dear Dr. Zajdel:

In answer to your questions re: package files:

1.  Each Package file must be saved with the EPK extension and should exist
in a unique subdirectory within the \E-Prime\Programs\Packages folder.  To
call a Package file within E-Prime, it must be added to the experiment via
the Packages tab in the Experiment Object Property Pages.  

Here are the two concerns for using PackageCalls:
-In any section where Property=Value, do not put spaces.
	For example, use PackageName="MyPackageName" versus PackageName =
"MyPackageName"
-Once that is done, the Subroutine definition is not valid

2. The most important thing to remember is that E-Studio ONLY loads the
definitions for each package when it loads, which means that you should
restart E-Prime to view newly added package files. A full reboot on the
machine is not necessary.   Any edits to the .epk file require the author to
close E-Studio and then reopen it.   Finally, any time you edit the .epk
file, and it changes API (for example, GetMyStuff takes three params instead
of 2), you must bump the VersionPersist so that E-Studio will handle
prompting of upgrading properly.  
No reboot, just shut down e-studio and restart

3. If there is an error within the package, E-Prime continues not only with
the current .epk file, but with the others as well

4. Functions are valid within the "Global" portion of the .epk file, but
there is no means in each of the Sub_??? calls that are defined.

E-Prime does not require that you have more than one .epk file. Instead, you
can have numerous amounts of Sub_??? routines in one .epk file that the
PackageCall will call.  From a maintenance perspective, only one .epk file
should be used if all the calls are related. 

5.  After consulting with our developers on this issue, it has been
concluded that there is not currently a way for a user to only setup a .dll
call and call it directly from a PackageCall.  However, there is a way to
call it from a package, as I have outlined below.  

[Header]
Library="MyExample"

[Global]
Declare Sub MyInit Lib "MyCode.dll" (ByVal strInit As String)

[Sub_MyExample_MyInit]
Public Sub MyExample_MyInit(strInit As String)
	'Call the .dll function
	Call MyInit strInit
End Sub

I hope this information is helpful.

Sincerely,

Eprime Technical Support, Sarah Burgess-

We are currently in the process of converting all our experiments to the
Eprime
platform, as well as upgrading existing experiments to the Beta 5.0 version.
Hoping to take advantage of some new features, we are trying to make use of
package calls, and have these questions:

1. Where do the packages go?  Exactly what path should be used.

2. Do I need to reboot to see them?  I do not see them when installing them
from the exp. properties.  I have seen them in the past.

3.  If there is an error in one package does eprime quit looking for other
packages?  I want to have at least 4 packages in one exp.

4. Are function type subroutines supported?  ( the ones that return values)
Or are just sub type subroutines?

5. What does the "dll" call information refer to in the packagecall
reference documentation?  It sounds something like dll call subroutines are
supported in someway by the packagecall interface mechanism.

Thank you as always for your help, guidance, and suppport.
